# About Alpine

Alpine Linux is a Linux distribution based on musl and BusyBox, designed for security, simplicity, and resource efficiency. 
It uses OpenRC for its init system and compiles all user-space binaries as position-independent executables with stack-smashing protection.

*Because of its small size, it is commonly used in containers providing quick boot-up times.*

## GUI

By default, Alpine doesn't include any GUI.

## Terminal

By default, there is no terminal, just the sh shell (no bash).
