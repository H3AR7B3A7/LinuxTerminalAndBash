# About Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software.
Ubuntu is officially released in three editions: Desktop, Server, and Core for Internet of things devices and robots.
All the editions can run on the computer alone, or in a virtual machine. Ubuntu is a popular operating system
for cloud computing, with support for OpenStack. Ubuntu's default desktop has been GNOME, since version 17.10.

## Advanced Packaging Tool

a free-software user interface that works with core libraries to handle the installation and removal of software on
Debian, Ubuntu, and related Linux distributions.
APT simplifies the process of managing software on Unix-like computer systems by automating the retrieval,
configuration and installation of software packages, either from precompiled files or by compiling source code.
