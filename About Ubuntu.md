# About Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on [Debian](About%20Debian.md) and composed mostly of free and open-source software.
Ubuntu is officially released in three editions: Desktop, Server, and Core for Internet of things devices and robots.
All the editions can run on the computer alone, or in a virtual machine. Ubuntu is a popular operating system
for cloud computing, with support for OpenStack. Ubuntu's default desktop has been GNOME, since version 17.10.


## Ubuntu Server

Like other distributions, Ubuntu comes in two editions:
- Desktop
- Server

The server edition has no GUI, instead it only uses the shell.
It is a lean (1 GB of disc space) efficient operating system, ideally only rarely requiring updates.
It has the same release schedule, but only LTS releases should be considered for server stability.

The installation differs significantly from the desktop version. However, it offers a lot of build in functionality,
like security and different software (to set up: webserver, mail server, files server, ...).

OpenSSH allows for controlling the server securely from a different machine.

## GUI

Ubuntu uses GNOME as desktop environment by default for most installations, which is loosely based on the Apple ecosystem.

## Terminal

Ubuntu uses GNOME Terminal by default.
