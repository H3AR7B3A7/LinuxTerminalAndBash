# About Ubuntu

## Advanced Packaging Tool

a free-software user interface that works with core libraries to handle the installation and removal of software on
Debian, Ubuntu, and related Linux distributions.
APT simplifies the process of managing software on Unix-like computer systems by automating the retrieval,
configuration and installation of software packages, either from precompiled files or by compiling source code.
