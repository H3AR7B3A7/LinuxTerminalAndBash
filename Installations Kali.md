# Kali Installations

## Before Starting

When uncertain about a packet name we can use:
>apt search name

Installing files can only be done by a super user.
We can either elevate our command temporarily by using:
>sudo

Or by elevating ourselves to super user (not recommended):
>sudo su

### Update APT

Before installing anything we might want to update the *advanced packaging tool*:
>sudo apt-get update  
>sudo apt-get upgrade -y  
>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y

### Removing Software

To remove packages installed with APT:
>sudo apt-get remove name
