# Penetration Testing

A penetration test, colloquially known as a pen test, pentest or ethical hacking,
is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system,
not to be confused with a vulnerability assessment. The test is performed to identify weaknesses
(also referred to as vulnerabilities), including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access
to the system's features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.

Google dorking could also be used for OSINT.

Some advanced operators:
- Cache
- Filetype
- Info
- Intitle
- Inurl
- Site
- ...

There are a lot of [examples](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database) we can find on the internet.
